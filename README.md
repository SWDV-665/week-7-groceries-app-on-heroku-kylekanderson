### Answers to submission questions

How many hours do you estimate you used completing this assignment?
I was able to complete the assignment this week rather quickly, as I had already setup the service layer for my final project app to run on Heroku. I estimate that I only spent about 45 minutes on the assignment this week.

What was easiest for you when completing this assignment?
Because I was able to replicate most of what I had already done for my final project app here, most of this assignment was fairly simple. Because the MongoDB add-on on Heroku is now deprecated and the only available add-on is an enterprise-level paid add-on, I instead chose to host my MongoDB database on MongoDB Atlas (using AWS) for free.

What was the most difficult challenge you experienced when completing this assignment?
Again, because I had already completed the tasks in this assignment for my final project app, there was nothing particularly difficult about this assignment this week.
